 Recurrent of Voltage collapse in complex power grids in Nature Communication.

 Note that there is no available code (2021-4) in the paper website or github. I recurrent the result of the paper.

 Recurrent Summarize: Most result of paper can be well recurrented, even though there might be small tricks on some number of the result. The result can be well finished in high-voltage networks, but it is not suitable for alternative current power flow.

Note that there may be difference of "the sorted and grouped by connected components of the subgraph". The result is a littble bit different but not crucial.

Some cases is well-fitted, but others are not, there might be some misunderstanding in the paper.

Figure 3

Why its the delta of raw paper is not a line? (scalar would let the delta multiply linearly).

The picture looked better since the Q_load become the major part.
